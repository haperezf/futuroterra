Offsets represent an emissions abatement\nthat occurs outside of the facility boundaries. This may\ninclude forestry projects such as reforestation or\navoided deforestation, grid connected renewable energy,\nfuel switching, refrigerant management, land based\nactivities, soil carbon sequestration and a host of\nother potential project types. Companies may choose\nto purchase offsets on the open market, enter into\ncontracts with other companies that are developing\nabatement projects or even be a project proponent of\nan abatement project outside of the facility boundaries.\nWhen using offsets, companies should be mindful of\nenvironmental integrity of the offsets themselves and\nthat the offset provider has the procedures in place\nto ensure that the offset projects are verified and the\noffsets being generated are fungible.\nFigure 16 — Energy storage options\nsruoH\nsetuniM\nsdnoceS\nMetal air batteries Hydrogen\nFlow batteries Pumped hydro\nSynthetic methane\nAdvanced lead acid batteries\nCryogenic air\nHigh energy\nsupercapacitors Molten salt batteries Compressed air\nLithium ion batteries\nLead acid batteries\nNickel cadmium\nbatteries\nHigh power flywheels\nNickel metal hydride batteries\nHigh power\nsupercapacitors\nCapacitors Superconducting magnets\n1 kW 100 kW 10 MW 1 GW\nType of storage: Physical Chemical Note—not to scale, illustrative only",
